On my way back from Belgium where I attended the Tetrahedron Symposium, I received an e-mail from the National Science Foundation informing me that my grant about photochemistry has been funded. I am super grateful to the chemistry division and to the American public for supporting our efforts to reach new chemical space with photochemistry by developing new reactions and studying their mechanisms. 

Naturally, none of this could have been done without the efforts of group members and colleagues, mentors, collaborators. 

Looking forward to the federally funded era for the lab!
