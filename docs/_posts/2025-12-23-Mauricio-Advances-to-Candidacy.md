title: Mauricio Advances to Candidacy
---
On December 9th, the third graduate student in the group has advanced to candidacy! Mauricio Bahena Garcia successfully passed his oral exam and can now focus all his efforts on his original scientific contribution that will be the bulk of his PhD thesis. Coincidentally, just after his defense, I accompanied him for a brief celebration of the Chancellor's fellowship that he obtained earlier in the year. This is the most prestigious fellowship a graduate student at the University of Kansas can have. It covers 3 full years of stipend and tuition. 
Mauricio joined the group in 2022 as a Fulbright fellow supported by the Fullbright – Garcia Robles STEM Regional Scholarship administered by the Mexico Commission for Educational and Cultural Exchange
(COMEXUS), initially on the Masters track. In 2024 he transferred to the PhD program. He has earned numerous awards both before and during his time at KU, and he had already published 3 papers in the group. 
Congratulations, Mauricio!
