            <h2><a href="resonance.html">Resonance and aromaticity</a></h2>
            <p>
                Move electrons within conjugated systems present in molecules 
                to find as many resonance contributors as possible. 
            </p>
            <p>The goal of this chemlet is to help you</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    learn to quickly identify conjugated sytems in structural diagrams.
                </li>
                <li>
                    learn which resonance structures contribute most to the stability of molecules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    understand that the actual structure is a hybrid of all its resonance contributors.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a href="cip.html">Stereocenter descriptors (<i>R</i> and <i>S</i>)</a></h2>
            <p>
                Follow the most commonly used CIP (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog) rules to determine the absolute configuration
                of stereocenters present in a molecule. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    identify which atoms in a molecule are stereocenters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    practice the use of CIP rules to determine which of the possibly many stereoisomers is being shown to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    understand how 3D information about a molecule is presented in structural diagrams.

            <h2><a href="protonation.html">Protonation and deprotonation</a></h2>
            <p>
                Protonate or deprotonate atoms in a molecule to indicate the dominant species in an aqueous solution at a given pH.
            </p>
            <p>The goal of this chemlet is to help you</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    identify which atoms in a molecule constitute functional groups that are Brønsted-Lowry acids or bases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    discover that amphiprotic molecules exist.

                <li>
                    familiarize yourself with the pKa values associated with functional groups and how they are influenced by the functional group's position within a molecule.

                <li>
                    determine the effect of an aqueous solution's pH on the structure of dissolved molecules; leading to the formation of ions or zwitterions, for example.

                <li>
                    understand how the pH of a solution ultimately affects molecular properties such as charge, polarity, solubility, hydrophilicity and reactivity.
